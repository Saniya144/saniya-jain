title: "Naive Bayes Spam Email Classifier"
# subtitle: "A Text-Based Comparative Study of Business and Labor Interest Group Power in U.S. Labor Rule-making"
excerpt: "This project implements a Spam Email Classifier using a probabilistic approach based on Naive Bayes theorem. The classifier is designed to distinguish between spam and non-spam (ham) emails by computing the probability of an email belonging to each category. The model leverages Bayesian inference and log-probability calculations to handle large feature spaces efficiently."

# Skills 

## Machine Learning and Data Science:​
Naive Bayes Classification – Implemented a probabilistic approach for spam detection.

Bayesian Inference – Applied Bayes' theorem to compute email classification probabilities.

Sparse Matrix Representation – Converted text data into a structured format for efficient processing.

​Feature Engineering for NLP – Processed email text, tokenized words, and extracted meaningful features.

Data Preprocessing – Cleaned and transformed raw email data before model training.

Model Evaluation Metrics – Assessed classifier performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Data Analysis & Visualization:​
Log-Probability Transformations – Used logarithms to handle small probabilities and prevent numerical underflow.

Scatter Plot Visualization – Plotted log probabilities to analyze classification boundaries.

Confusion Matrix Analysis – Evaluated false positives and false negatives for model improvement.

Data Exploration & Summary Statistics – Analyzed word distributions and frequency patterns in emails.
