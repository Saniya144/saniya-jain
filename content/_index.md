title: "Saniya Jain"
subtitle: "Social Impact Data Scientist"
description: "I'm a senior at UMass Amherst majoring in Data Science and Economics, with a passion for solving real-world problems through data. Whether it's modeling labor policy, analyzing housing access, or visualizing climate vulnerability, I love using data to make sense of complex systems and inform meaningful change. My interests sit at the intersection of data science, policy, and social impact. I’m especially excited by the role of data in shaping smarter decisions around energy, sustainability, climate change, and development economics. Alongside my technical work, I’m equally passionate about leadership and building impact-driven teams. From leading student consulting groups to mentoring research teams, I thrive in collaborative environments where ideas are shared freely, and bold thinking is encouraged."
